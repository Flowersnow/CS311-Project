# CS311-Project

Repo for CPSC 311 Term Project

Refer to https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.9.5/reqwest/ and https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest for HTTP Rust Client. Most of the code/setup is borrowed from there. Added new file sync-stock.rs, which is a synchronous call using the API from https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/. Currently using Intraday with interval 1min.
